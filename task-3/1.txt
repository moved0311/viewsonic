1. Simply describe what "function1" will do.

function1 is a generator function that sends different Redux actions based on different results.
1. Create an AbortController and pass AbortController.signal into axios to stop the axios call.
2. If the axios call succeeds, dispatch an action to reducer 1.
3. If the axios call fails, dispatch an action to reducer 2.
4. If the axios call is aborted, dispatch an action to reducer 3.
